# Secretsea
Secretsea was a social network that participate in a high school local conference in 2016. My first real project back then. Buggy, lucks good architecture and modern design patterns. Using PHP with AJAX.

After 9 months of development, Secretsea launched at February 2016. Despite the good expectations, it was abandoned four months later.
