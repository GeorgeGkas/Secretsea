#Secretsea
Secretsea was my high school project for local conference in 2016. It was a social network. My first real project back then. Buggy, lucks good architecture and modern design patterns. Using PHP with AJAX. It was serious back then. Now I laugh. But hey....if you don't start something you'll never learn. 

After 9 months of development, Secretsea launched at February 2016. Despite the good expectations, it was abandoned four months later.
